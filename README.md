# FastBTTB
Fast multiplications for matrices with block Toeplitz Toeplitz block structure
This MATLAB software provides functions that generate the kernels used in gravity and magnetic data forward modeling.

The full matrices are generated for comparison

The transform matrices that are required for fast BTTB implementation are also generated

A script that tests the software  for gravity and magnetic kernels is provided. 

Run Testing_Script.m and make sure all functions and scripts are in the same directory

This is all described in the paper that can be found on arxiv
A Tutorial and Open Source Software for the Efficient Evaluation of Gravity and Magnetic Kernels (2019)
